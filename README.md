# From axioms over graphs to vectors, and back again: evaluating the properties of graph-based ontology embeddings

## Abstract: 

Several approaches have been developed that generate embeddings for Description Logic ontologies and
use these embeddings in machine learning. One approach of generating ontologies embeddings is by
first embedding the ontologies into a graph structure, i.e., introducing a set of nodes and edges for named
entities and logical axioms, and then applying a graph embedding to embed the graph in R ùëõ . Methods
that embed ontologies in graphs (graph projections) have different formal properties related to the type
of axioms they can utilize, whether the projections are invertible or not, and whether they can be applied
to asserted axioms or their deductive closure. We analyze several graph projection methods that have
been used to embed ontologies qualitatively and quantitatively, and we demonstrate the effect of the
properties of graph projections on the performance of predicting axioms from ontology embeddings. We
find that there are substantial differences between different projection methods, and both the projection
of axioms into nodes and edges as well ontological choices in representing knowledge will impact the
success of using ontology embeddings to predict axioms.

## Method and results

The projections used in this analyses were:

* Onto2Graph projection
* Projection found in OWL2Vec*
* RDF rendering of OWL

The ontologies used were:
* Gene Ontology (GO)
* Food Ontology (FoodOn)

## Setting up

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8
- Anaconda

### Set up environment

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/ontology-graph-projections.git

cd ontology-graph-projections
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate projections

cd use_cases
```

### Getting the data

The data is located in the `use_cases` directory. You will find the files `use_cases/go/go_data.tar.gz` for GO and `use_cases/foodon/foodon_data.tar.gz` for FoodOn. Uncompress the files with:

```
cd use_cases/go/
tar -xzvf go_data.tar.gz
```

and 

```
cd use_cases/foodon/
tar -xzvf foodon_data.tar.gz
```

For example, to train the Gene Ontology reduced version with the taxonomy projection, we can run
```
python run_model.py -case go -g taxonomy -kge transe -r go/data -dim 64 -m 0.2 -wd 0.0001 -bs 4096 -lr 0.1 -tbs 8 -e 4000 -d cuda -rd results_tax_sub.csv -tf foodon/data/go_subsumption_closure_filtered.csv -ts -rs
```
